# Bootstrap-Portfolio
This is a portfolio website designed using HTML5, CSS3, and the Bootstrap CSS library.

## Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to build upon the front-end skills we have developed further by using the Bootstrap library (the CSS portion). Using this library allows us to quickly design stylish and responsive webpages.
