                    My name is Devin North and I'm an aspiring full-stack web developer from Far West Texas. I've lived in the Houston area for three years and have fallen in love with the city. I love anything with a processor, am an avid video game enthusiast, and a proud "computer nerd".

                    A transplant to the Gulf Coast area of Texas from the deserts of West Texas (region, not the town), I'm getting used to the humidity. I find it very hard to talk about myself, hence using a paragraph intended to reveal insights about myself taking a turn for the bland with some weather talk. Next I'll talk about airplane food (what's the deal, it tastes so bad, amirite?) and Houston traffic (I mean come on people, drive, amirite?). I've never had an airplane meal, I was putting on. I was terrified of flying for the longest time. I don't like travelling in vehicles that I have no control over. I guess I get anxiety over the idea that I'm no longer in control of my fate, it's almost entirely in someone else's hands. But they're capable hands, right? That Southwest pilot recently just landed a plane that had an exploded engine. Maybe my fear of air travel is just a manifestation of some deeper-seated, more primal fear of loss of control, inevitable death.

                    I've been told I'm over-analytical. But hey, that makes for a great programmer right? Probably? Hire me! plz.
